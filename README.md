This repository contains sample applications which demonstrate connecting to
Battle.net using the OAuth 2.0 authentication standard.

If you would like to see more examples, please create an issue.

## Creating An OAuth Client

Information about creating OAuth clients and integrating with Battle.net APIs
can be found on the [Battle.net Developer Portal].

Here is a quick rundown on creating an OAuth client to get started with the samples
located here.

1. Go to the [Battle.net Developer Portal]
2. Log into your Battle.net account, or create a free account.
3. Click on API Access at the top, or Create Clients
4. Click Create Client
5. Fill out your client information. You can always go back and change this later.
6. Setup Redirect URIs (for these samples, use `https://localhost:8080` and `http://localhost:8080`)
7. After creating your client, make note of your client ID and secret.
